# Day 7 of my AWS-DevOps-Zero-To-Hero Challenge

## Topic- AWS CLI & CloudFormation

This repository contains my **Day 7 learning** focused on **AWS automation** using the **AWS CLI** and **AWS CloudFormation**.

---

## AWS CLI

The AWS CLI section documents hands-on usage of AWS services directly from the command line, including:
- CLI configuration using IAM user credentials
- Creating and managing AWS resources (S3, EC2, IAM, CloudWatch)
- Verifying access and cleaning up resources

📄 Detailed commands and steps are available in:
### AWS-CLI/README.md

---

## AWS CloudFormation

The CloudFormation section demonstrates **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** by provisioning a complete EC2-based application stack using a YAML template, including networking, security, and automated Apache installation.

📄 Full implementation and explanation are available in:
### AWS-CloudFormation/CloudFormation-Template/README.md

## Summary

Day 7 focuses on moving from **manual AWS operations** to **automation and repeatability** using CLI commands and CloudFormation templates.
