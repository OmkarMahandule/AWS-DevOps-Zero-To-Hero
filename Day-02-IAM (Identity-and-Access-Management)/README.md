# Day 02 — AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

## Objectives
- Understand AWS IAM fundamentals
- Create users, groups, and roles
- Apply correct permissions
- Follow security best practices

---

## What I Did

- Created IAM users with limited access
- Created IAM groups and attached policies
- Assigned users to groups
- Tested permission boundaries
- Explored IAM roles and use cases

---

## Key Concepts Learned

### IAM Users
Individual identities for people or services that interact with AWS.

### IAM Groups
Collection of users with shared permissions.

### IAM Roles
Temporary permissions assigned to AWS services or users.

### Least Privilege Principle
Grant only the permissions required — nothing more.

## Security Best Practices

- Never use root account for daily work
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Use roles instead of long-term credentials
- Apply least privilege access
- Rotate credentials regularly

---

## Lessons Learned

Security is not optional in DevOps.  
IAM mistakes can expose entire cloud environments.
